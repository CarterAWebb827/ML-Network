## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze network traffic data and predict simulated attacks using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the "Improved CICIDS2017 and CSECICIDS2018" dataset.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Required Libraries
You will need to install the following libraries:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For label encoder
- **TQDM**: For progress bar
- **PSUtil**: For getting RAM usage
- **imblearn**: For over sampling help
- **Kaggle**: For downloading datasets from Kaggle.

### Install Libraries
You can install the required libraries using pip. Run the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tqdm psutil imblearn kaggle
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Add your `kaggle.json` API token file to the appropriate location. For detailed instructions, see the [Kaggle API documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api).

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python ML-Network-Training.py
```

You will be prompted to provide the full path to your `kaggle.json` file.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Improved CICIDS2017 and CSECICIDS2018" dataset, which includes network traffic data with simulated attacks. This data is crucial for training and testing the machine learning models.
